      { type: 'p', text: 'A buyer from Amsterdam visited our Cao County factory last March. He had been ordering tea boxes from us for two years — about 18,000 units a year for his retail brand in the Netherlands — but he had never seen the place in person. After we picked him up at Heze airport we drove the 45 minutes east, pulled into the yard around ten in the morning, and parked next to the timber pile.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'He stood at the timber pile for ten minutes without saying a word. Then he turned to me and asked: "How long does it actually take to make one of my boxes?"' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'The honest answer is that a single tea box, from rough timber to packed export carton, takes roughly 14 calendar days and about 26 minutes of actual labor. The 14 days is mostly drying time, finishing cure time, and waiting for batches to consolidate. The 26 minutes is what you are paying for.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'What follows is what those 26 minutes actually look like, broken into the six manufacturing steps every box at our 15,000 m² facility goes through. We have learned that the buyers who understand this process end up making better decisions about their products. They specify smarter, they negotiate smarter, and they catch problems earlier — which is worth a lot more than any pricing argument.' },

      { type: 'h2', text: 'Step 1 — Timber selection and kiln drying' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Every order starts at our timber yard. Paulownia, pine, bamboo, acacia, walnut and oak are stored in roofed but open-sided sheds, segregated by species and grade. Before any board touches a saw it has to pass through our drying kilns and reach 8–12% moisture content (MC).' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'This single step is the biggest reason cheap wooden boxes fail in the field. Wood at 18% MC will warp, cup, crack or split once it lands in a 30% relative humidity warehouse in Florida or a 60% humid summer in Sydney. We see it all the time — buyers who took the cheapest quote on the market and ended up with a 12% defect rate three months after their first shipment, then came to us to start over.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Our kilns run at 60–80°C with controlled humidity for anywhere from 7 to 21 days depending on board thickness and species. Walnut and oak take the longest because they are dense; paulownia dries fastest because it is light. Every board is checked with a pin-style moisture meter before it leaves the kiln, and the readings are logged.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'This step adds maybe $0.05 to the cost of a tea box. It saves $5 in returns and replacements. The math is not subtle.' },
      { type: 'img', src: '/factory/material.webp', caption: 'Our raw material yard — kiln-dried stock organized by species and grade' },

      { type: 'h2', text: 'Step 2 — Cutting to size' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Once timber is dry, boards move into the dimensioning room. This is where we turn raw planks into the precisely sized parts that will become a box.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'We use industrial table saws, panel saws and a computer-controlled beam saw for high-volume orders. Tolerances at this stage are ±0.5 mm — tighter than you need for furniture, but necessary for boxes where the lid has to sit flush and the joinery has to lock together cleanly.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'For a custom order, we program the saws directly from your CAD file or from our internal 3D mockup. Every part gets cut to spec — sides, top, bottom, base, lid frame, lid panel, dividers — with no eyeballing and no guesswork. Our nesting software arranges the parts on each board to minimize offcut waste, typically achieving 88–92% material yield. Offcuts go to a sister facility that produces wooden beads, handles and small turned components, so almost nothing reaches landfill.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Cut parts leave this stage as labeled stacks, organized by box and by SKU. From here they go to the joinery shop.' },

      { type: 'h2', text: 'Step 3 — Shape and joinery' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Step 3 is where boxes pick up their personality. CNC routers handle every cut that is not a straight line: chamfered and rounded edges, dado grooves for sliding lids, mortises for hinges and locks, finger joints and dovetails for sides, slots for internal dividers.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Each CNC machine runs from a CAM file generated from the same 3D model that drove the saws. Tolerances here are tighter — ±0.3 mm — because the parts have to fit together cleanly without visible glue lines or hardware-induced gaps.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'This is also where the box\'s "feel" gets engineered. A 2 mm chamfer on a lid edge changes how a buyer\'s hand reads the box. A finger joint shows craftsmanship; a butt joint with internal screws hides it. A 1 mm radius on internal divider edges takes longer to machine but means the dividers do not gouge whatever is stored inside. The choices we make at this stage are mostly invisible to the end user — but they are exactly what separates a $3 box from a $30 box.' },
      { type: 'img', src: '/folder/3-mortise-cutting.webp', caption: 'CNC mortise cutting for hinges and lock recesses' },

      { type: 'h2', text: 'Step 4 — Pre-assembly and dry-fit' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Before any glue or hardware goes in, every part of the box is dry-fitted to confirm joinery is tight, lids close flat, drawers slide smoothly. This sounds obvious but most lower-end factories skip it — they go straight from cut parts to glue-up and hope for the best.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'We catch about 2–3% of parts at this stage. Usually small things: a divider slot that is 0.4 mm too tight, a hinge mortise that needs cleaning out, a base panel that has cupped slightly during finishing prep. These get sent back to the joinery shop to be re-cut on the spot.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'The cost of catching a problem here is about 30 seconds of an operator\'s time. The cost of catching the same problem after final assembly is 15 minutes of disassembly, refinishing and re-glue. The cost of catching it after a customer complaint is the box itself, plus replacement freight, plus the brand damage you cannot put a number on.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'This is one of the steps you should ask any factory about when you visit. If they cannot show you a dry-fit station, they do not have one — and your defect rate will tell you about it later.' },

      { type: 'h2', text: 'Step 5 — Sanding, finishing and polishing' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Once boxes are glued and clamped, they move to the finishing line. Our finishing line has three sub-steps that together account for almost half the labor in a box.' },
      { type: 'h3', text: 'Sanding' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Boxes go through three grits in sequence — 180, 240, 320 — and a fourth pass at 400 grit for premium walnut and oak work. Most of the sanding is done by hand because corners and inside edges are hard to reach with orbital sanders. Each box takes about 4–5 minutes at this stage. A skilled sander is one of the most valuable people in the factory.' },
      { type: 'h3', text: 'Finishing' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Finish choice depends on the box. Food-safe lacquer for tea boxes, spice racks and bread bins. Beeswax or mineral oil for cutting boards and serving boxes. Water-based lacquer (low-VOC, EU REACH and US CARB P2 compliant) for general use. Premium walnut and oak get oil + wax for that hand-finished look that machine-applied finishes cannot match.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Each finish coat needs to cure for 4–8 hours before the next coat. This is the biggest single contributor to the 14-day calendar lead time — the wood is doing nothing, but the finish is curing. Skipping cure time produces finishes that look fine on day one and feel sticky in week three.' },
      { type: 'h3', text: 'Polishing' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'After the final finish coat cures, boxes get hand-polished with a soft cotton wheel. This is the difference between a box that looks "manufactured" and one that looks "crafted." It adds about 2 minutes per box but it is one of the first things buyers notice when they unbox a sample.' },
      { type: 'img', src: '/folder/5-polishing.webp', caption: 'Hand polishing after the final finish coat — 2 extra minutes that buyers notice' },

      { type: 'h2', text: 'Step 6 — QC, packing and export documentation' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Every order goes through a 3-stage quality control process. We are obsessive about this — it is how a factory of our size keeps a defect rate that buyers can verify with their own third-party inspections.' },
      { type: 'h3', text: 'Stage 1 — Incoming material inspection' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Done at the timber yard. Boards that are too wet, too warped, or have unacceptable knots, splits or color variation never enter the production stream. About 5–8% of incoming timber gets rejected at this stage and returned to the supplier.' },
      { type: 'h3', text: 'Stage 2 — In-process checks' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Random sampling at the cutting, joinery and pre-assembly stages. About 1 in every 20 parts gets measured against the spec drawing with calipers. Anything outside tolerance triggers a re-check of the previous 50 parts and, if needed, a re-calibration of the saw or CNC.' },
      { type: 'h3', text: 'Stage 3 — Pre-shipment final inspection' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Every single finished box gets visually checked against the approved sample. Lids are opened and closed. Drawers are slid. Hardware is tested. Surfaces are inspected under bright light. About 0.4% of boxes fail this final inspection and either get reworked or scrapped — that is the defect rate we publish to buyers.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Once boxes pass final QC, they are wrapped in tissue or polybags, packed into individual retail cartons or bulk master cartons, palletized, and loaded with the full export documentation packet: commercial invoice with HS codes, packing list with carton-by-carton breakdown, phytosanitary certificate for solid wood, certificate of origin, and bill of lading.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'This documentation goes to your forwarder before the container leaves the port. It is what turns a pallet of boxes into something that can clear customs in 60+ countries without delay.' },

      { type: 'h2', text: 'Seven questions to ask any factory' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'If you are evaluating a wooden box factory — visiting in person, doing a video tour, or just doing due diligence by email — here are the seven questions that, in our experience, separate real production-grade manufacturers from agents and middlemen who sub-contract to anyone available.' },
      { type: 'list', items: [
        '"What moisture content do you dry timber to, and how do you measure it?" — anything other than "8-12%, with pin-style meter readings logged" is a warning sign.',
        '"Can I see your dry-fit station?" — if they look confused, they do not have one.',
        '"What is your incoming material rejection rate, and what happens to rejected boards?" — should be 5-8% rejection, returned to supplier.',
        '"How many QC stages do you have, and what triggers a re-check?" — should be 3 stages with documented triggers.',
        '"Can I see the test reports for your finishes?" — REACH, CARB and food-safe certificates should be ready in 24 hours.',
        '"What is your typical defect rate at final inspection?" — under 1% is good, under 0.5% is excellent.',
        '"How do you handle problems caught after shipment?" — the answer reveals more about the factory than any sales pitch will.',
      ]},
      { type: 'p', text: 'A factory that answers all seven crisply with documents to back them up is one you can build a long-term relationship with. A factory that pivots to "we have great quality, trust me" without specifics is one to walk away from — politely and quickly.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Every shortcut taken in our six-step process shows up somewhere downstream — usually in a customer warehouse or on an Amazon review page. The most common shortcuts and what they cost:' },
      { type: 'h3', text: 'Skipping kiln drying' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Saves about 7-14 days of production time and roughly $0.05 per box. Costs you a 5-15% defect rate three months after shipment when boxes warp in destination climates. Net: catastrophic for repeat business.' },
      { type: 'h3', text: 'Skipping dry-fit' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Saves about 30 seconds per box. Costs you 2-3% rework rate at final assembly, plus invisible defects that pass internal QC and surface as customer complaints. Net: 15-20× the time saved.' },
      { type: 'h3', text: 'Reducing finish coats from 3 to 2' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Saves 4-8 hours of cure time and about $0.15 per box. Costs you visibly thin finish that wears through within a year of normal use. Net: cheap on day one, expensive on day 365.' },

      { type: 'quote', text: 'Six steps, every box. The discipline of doing the same six steps the same way every time is what makes a wooden box manufacturer reliable at scale. Anything else is just hoping.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'That Amsterdam buyer flew home the next day with photographs of his next 18,000 boxes coming off the line. He has not asked the question again — but every time we onboard a new buyer we walk them through these six steps, in person if they can visit, on video if not. The more you understand what is actually happening between order confirmation and dock-side delivery, the better the boxes you end up with.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'And the better the conversations you can have with us when something does not look right — because in manufacturing, something always eventually does not look right, and how it gets fixed is what defines a real partnership.' },

Sometimes it matters more than the design itself.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'And yet most buyers spend ten minutes on it. They pick "pine" or "paulownia" because that is what they saw on the last project, or because that is what the factory quoted. Six months and one container later they discover the box was twice as heavy as it needed to be, and the freight ate their margin.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Here is how we think about each species when a buyer asks us "which wood should I use?" — written for the buyer side of the conversation, with real cost framing.' },

      { type: 'h2', text: 'The hidden cost: freight, not material' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Most buyers focus on material cost per board-foot. That is the wrong number. For most gift packaging projects shipped from China, the freight component dominates — especially for bulky retail boxes shipped LCL or via Amazon FBA.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'A 25 cm cube made from oak weighs roughly 4 kg. The same cube made from paulownia weighs about 1.6 kg. On a 20-foot container holding 6,000 of those boxes, you are talking about a 14,400 kg difference in chargeable weight. That is real money.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Material cost matters. Freight cost matters more. Pick wood for both.' },

      { type: 'h2', text: 'Paulownia — the volume default' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Paulownia is the lightest commercial timber on Earth — density around 280 kg/m³, which is roughly half of pine and a third of oak. For high-volume gift packaging it wins on freight cost alone, before you consider any other variable.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'It is also dimensionally the most stable wood we work with. It will not warp or crack across humidity changes, which is critical for boxes shipped to dry climates (Phoenix, Australia interior) or humid ones (Florida, Southeast Asia). And its straight even grain takes laser engraving cleanly with high contrast.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'The downside: paulownia is soft. Janka hardness around 300 — easy to dent if dropped or stacked aggressively. So it is not what you want for a tool box or a serving caddy that is going to live a hard life. But for a gift box that gets opened once and then displayed on a shelf, paulownia is almost always the right call.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Best for: large gift boxes, wine boxes, subscription packaging, FBA-bound products, anything where freight matters.' },

      { type: 'h2', text: 'Pine — affordable and rustic' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Scots pine and radiata pine give you classic warm grain at the lowest price-per-board-foot of any softwood we stock. We work with two grades: knot-free pine for clean retail packaging, and rustic knotty pine for crate-style wine and farmhouse-themed gifting.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Pine takes wood-burning beautifully — branded wine boxes with burned-in vintage and producer name are pine\'s signature application. It also stains evenly, paints cleanly, and oils to a deep amber over time.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'It is heavier than paulownia (~510 kg/m³) but less dimensionally stable than acacia or walnut. We dry it carefully and recommend it for products that are not crossing extreme climate zones. For a wine box going from China to a UK distributor, pine is fine; for a wine box going from China to a Phoenix retailer in July, we would push you toward paulownia or kiln-dried oak.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Technically bamboo is a grass, not a tree. It regrows in 5–7 years versus 30–60 years for hardwood, which makes it the most genuinely renewable structural material on the planet. For brands with an explicit eco message, bamboo is the only honest choice.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Bamboo also happens to be naturally antibacterial — making it the default choice for kitchen products, bath accessories and anything that touches food or skin. It is harder than red oak (Janka ~1380), more water-resistant than most hardwoods, and finishes to a beautiful warm-gold or carbonized-caramel surface.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'The trade-off: bamboo grain is striped rather than swirling. If you want a "natural wood" look, bamboo reads as obviously bamboo, not as wood. Some brands love that look (Muji-style minimalism, Japanese-influenced design). Others find it too modern and want the swirling grain of acacia or oak.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'It is naturally water-resistant — important for kitchen and bath applications — and finishes beautifully with just oil and wax, no lacquer needed. The grain variation means every box looks subtly different, which buyers either love (uniqueness, hand-craftedness) or dislike (consistency concerns for retail).' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Their original spec called for European beech — a beautiful pale hardwood that they had seen on a competitor\'s product.

Same visual lightness, less than half the actual weight, identical premium feel after staining. Final unit cost landed at $3.65 — under budget by 9%, with the FBA fee savings funding the white-stain finish that beech would not have needed.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Brief: 5,000 units per quarter, single-bottle wine box with rope handle, distributed through small-batch wine retailers and restaurant suppliers. Budget: $5.50 per box landed.' },

      { type: 'h2', text: '1. The lid sits flat — every time' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'A lid that gaps even 0.5 mm at one corner kills the perceived quality of the entire box. It does not matter how beautiful the wood is or how nice the lining feels — a gappy lid reads as cheap.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Achieving a flat-sitting lid across thousands of units requires three things. First, kiln-dried timber at 8–12% MC so the wood does not move in transit. Second, precision-cut lid grooves and box rims with tolerances under 0.3 mm. Third, quality hinges installed with proper jigs so they sit square. Cheap factories miss any one of these and the lid will twist within six months.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'When we sample a new design, the first thing we check after assembly is whether you can slide a piece of paper between the lid and the box rim at any of the four corners. If you can, the box goes back to be re-fitted before it leaves the factory.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Soft-close means the lid descends slowly under spring tension and meets the case with no slam. The mechanism adds about $0.40 per box at our typical volumes — a small upgrade for a feature that most buyers immediately notice and remember.' },

      { type: 'h3', text: 'How do I prevent finish damage from the watch case touching the lining?' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Use microfiber rather than velvet — microfiber has shorter fibers that are less abrasive against polished case surfaces. For premium watches with sapphire case-backs, suggest customers store the watch on the pillow with the case-back down (sapphire is hardier than the dial-side glass). Avoid suede pillow surfaces for premium watches; suede sheds particles that can scratch.' },

      { type: 'h3', text: 'What about humidity for boxes that store collection watches?' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Most consumer watch storage does not need humidity control — a wooden box on a dresser is fine. For valuable collection storage (10+ premium watches, especially mechanical movements), recommend a dedicated watch winder or watch safe with humidity control built in. Wooden display boxes are not the right product category for serious collection storage.' },

      { type: 'h3', text: 'Can I get my brand stamped into the wood interior?' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Yes — laser engraving on the inside of the lid is a popular subtle branding option. About $0.10 per box added for laser time. Visible only when the customer opens the box, which is exactly when they are paying attention. Some buyers also engrave a serial number for limited-edition runs.' },

      { type: 'h3', text: 'How long does the lining hold up?' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Microfiber lining in normal use lasts 5-10 years before showing meaningful wear. Velvet wears noticeably within 1-2 years of regular handling. Faux leather and structured fabric linings last roughly as long as microfiber. The pillow inside, if it gets compressed regularly, may need replacement after 3-5 years — we offer replacement pillow inserts for premium boxes.' },

      { type: 'h2', text: 'A note for first-time watch box buyers' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Watch box specifications drift quickly into the weeds — there are dozens of small decisions, each costing $0.10-1.00 and each subtly affecting the final product. The temptation is to leave the details to the factory and trust that "they will use sensible defaults."' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'In our experience this rarely produces a great box. Defaults are designed for the broadest market, not for your specific positioning. Spend the time to specify hinge type, lining material, pillow firmness, hardware finish and outer carton style explicitly. Get a sample with all those choices made. Hold the sample. Decide if it feels right. Then commit to volume.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'The watch box is the only physical brand asset most of your customers will touch. Specifying it right is worth the extra hours.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Watch box buyers are picky for a reason — they are spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on the product the box holds, and the box is the first physical impression of the brand. The detail items in this article are mostly small: $0.40 here, 0.5 mm there, an extra 30 seconds of QC per unit. Added together they are the difference between a watch box that becomes part of the customer\'s home and one that gets thrown out the next time the closet is cleaned.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'If you are sourcing watch boxes for the first time, we strongly recommend ordering a 50-piece sample run before committing to volume. Take the boxes apart in person, run the lid through 200 open-close cycles, drop one from desk height, leave one in the trunk of your car for a week. The boxes that survive that are the boxes that will survive your customers.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'The important thing to understand about FSC is that the certification covers the wood, not the box. Our boxes are FSC-certified when both (a) the timber comes from FSC-certified suppliers AND (b) the production batch passes through our certified chain of custody process. We have to keep batch records, segregate FSC stock from non-FSC stock during production, and produce a per-shipment certificate that traces back to the source.' },

The third option — a slightly firmer EVA foam with quicker recovery — produced the perfect "snap" of immediate visual readiness on opening. The buyer added $0.18 per unit for the upgraded foam. The fragrance launch went well; the unboxing video produced 800,000 organic Instagram views.' },

      { type: 'h3', text: 'How long does a 100-piece trial actually take?' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Typically 12-18 days from order confirmation to trial-run shipment. About 7-10 days production, 3-5 days shipping by air. We use air freight for trial runs because the time savings outweigh the cost on small quantities.' },
      { type: 'h3', text: 'Can I get even smaller — like 25 pieces?' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Yes, but the per-unit cost rises sharply (typically 60-100% premium over 100-piece pricing) because the production setup is the same regardless. For 25-piece trials we usually recommend treating them as paid sampling rather than trial runs — the volume is too small to fully exercise the production line.' },
      { type: 'h3', text: 'Should I run a trial for every reorder?' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'No. Once a design has been produced successfully at scale and reorders are pure repeat orders with no design changes, trials are unnecessary. Trial runs are for new designs and significant design modifications. Repeat orders go straight to production with normal QC.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'You keep them. They are real production-quality boxes (assuming no major issues found). Most buyers use trial units for marketing photography, retail seeding, or as initial inventory. Some buyers use them as the basis for early customer reviews on Amazon or Shopify. Either way, the units are not disposable — they are your first 100 units of inventory.' },

      { type: 'quote', text: 'A sample run is the cheapest insurance you can buy. It costs more per unit, and it pays for itself in problems you never have to fix.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'For first-time buyers, we recommend treating the 100-piece trial as part of the project budget from the start, not as an optional add-on. Build it into your launch timeline. Build it into your SKU pricing. Build it into your relationship with the factory. Once it is normal practice, you stop seeing the 12% defect rates and last-minute production fires that plague buyers who skip this step. Most of our largest, longest-running customer relationships started exactly this way: with a small trial that built trust before either side committed to volume.' },

Two sellers can offer the same wooden box at the same retail price and end up with completely different unit economics — one profitable, one losing money on every sale — because of decisions they made about packaging.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Amazon charges fulfillment fees by dimensional weight, not actual weight. Dimensional weight is calculated as length × width × height ÷ 139 (in inches and pounds), so a bulky lightweight product can incur fees as if it were many times its actual weight.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'For wooden products this matters more than for almost any other category, because wood density varies dramatically by species. A 30 cm cube of oak weighs roughly 4 kg. The same cube in paulownia weighs about 1.6 kg. Both ship for the same FBA fee — but if you specified oak when paulownia would have worked, you are paying twice the freight cost into Amazon\'s warehouse for nothing.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'For high-volume products where the wood is not the visible feature (most gift packaging — the customer sees the lid surface, not the cross-section), choosing the lighter species can save $0.40-1.20 per unit in inbound freight. Across 10,000 units that is $4,000-12,000 of pure margin gained.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'A typical pre-shipment inspection costs $250-380 and takes one working day. The inspector visits our factory, samples to AQL 2.5 standards (about 32 units sampled from a 1,000-unit lot), inspects against your spec sheet, and produces a report with photographs.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Cheap installation crews over-tighten hinge screws to compensate for poorly cut mortises. The wood fibers around the screw compress; over time the screw loosens; the hinge sags; the lid no longer sits flat.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Cheap installation skips polarity testing. Reversed-polarity magnets repel rather than attract — the lid pushes itself open instead of snapping closed.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Spot check: every box should have its closure mechanism tested at final QC. If you find even one reversed-polarity unit in a sample run, demand a 100% inspection of the production line.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Tier 1 cam locks and combination locks use stamped metal pins and weak return springs. Pins bend, springs lose tension, the lock either jams or stops engaging properly within a year of regular use.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Spot check: cycle the lock at least 30 times during sample inspection. If you feel any grit, hesitation or sticking, the mechanism is undergrade.' },

      { type: 'h2', text: 'When to upgrade — the cost-vs-quality math' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Hardware is one of the most leveraged upgrades in a wooden box. Upgrading a single hinge from Tier 1 to Tier 2 typically adds $0.20-0.40 per box. Upgrading the entire hardware spec from Tier 1 to Tier 3 (premium European) adds $1.50-3.50 per box.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Three rules of thumb for when the upgrade is worth it:' },
      { type: 'list', items: [
        'Retail price tier — at $40+ retail, hardware quality starts to define the brand impression. At $100+ retail, premium hardware is essentially mandatory.',
        'Use frequency — products that get opened daily (kitchen, jewelry, watch storage) wear hardware fastest. Use frequency × years of expected ownership = total hardware cycles. Above 5,000 cycles, upgrade pays for itself in failure avoidance.',
        'Brand positioning — heritage / heirloom / premium positioning requires hardware that visibly justifies the position. Cheap hardware on a premium-positioned product reads as "they cut corners somewhere," which damages the entire brand impression.',
      ]},

      { type: 'h2', text: 'Frequently asked hardware questions' },
      { type: 'h3', text: 'Can I supply my own hardware?' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Yes — many higher-volume buyers do exactly this. Source the hardware separately, ship it to our factory in Cao County, and we install it. The complication is timing: hardware needs to arrive at our factory at least 5 days before production start, with documentation matching the production order. For first-time buyers we usually recommend our hardware first; once the relationship and process are established, customer-supplied hardware is straightforward.' },

      { type: 'h3', text: 'How many spare keys should I include?' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Standard is 2 keys per lock (one main, one spare). For high-end products we recommend 3 keys: 2 for the customer plus 1 for branded packaging display in the retail box. Adding extra keys costs about $0.10-0.20 per key.' },

      { type: 'h3', text: 'Do magnetic closures interfere with watches or electronics?' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'In theory yes; in practice almost never. The neodymium magnets we use are weak compared to anything that would meaningfully magnetize a watch (consumer wristwatch tolerance is around 60 gauss; our N42 magnets generate field strengths well below that at 1cm distance). For storage of vintage mechanical watches with very low magnetic tolerance, we can spec non-magnetic closures (latch or hidden hook) instead.' },

      { type: 'h3', text: 'What is the lifetime of a properly specified hinge?' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'A Tier 2 concealed European hinge with soft-close mechanism is rated for approximately 80,000 open-close cycles. At 5 cycles per day (heavy use), that is 40+ years. Tier 3 German Häfele or Blum hinges are rated for 200,000+ cycles. Tier 1 hinges are typically rated for 5,000-10,000 cycles, which is roughly 3-5 years of daily use before noticeable wear.' },

      { type: 'h3', text: 'Are stainless steel hinges always better than brass?' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Stainless steel is more corrosion-resistant (relevant for kitchen and bath products); brass is more visually warm and traditional (relevant for premium gifting). Choose based on the use environment and the brand voice. Both have premium versions.' },

      { type: 'quote', text: 'Hardware is the part of a wooden box that gets used the most and specified the least. Spec it like it matters — because the hinge that fails in month seven becomes the one-star review that sticks for years.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'For first-time buyers, we recommend doing one round of sampling specifically focused on hardware. Order three samples of the same box with three different hardware grades — Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3. Open and close each one a hundred times. Feel the difference in your hand. The choice that feels right to you is almost always the one your customer will respond to. The hardware is a small percentage of the cost; it is most of the perceived quality.' },
